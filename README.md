# MDI Apps Framework

The [Rusty Data Interface](https://rustydataint.github.io/) (RuDI) 
is a standardized framework for developing and running HPC data 
analysis **pipelines** and interactive visualization **apps**
with a Rust-first mindset.

This is the repository for the **MDI apps framework**. 
It contains R Shiny code that
creates the modular graphical user interface via
a web server and runs individual data analysis apps. 
The framework thus provides a common access point to many data apps.

The apps framework does not encode the data analysis apps themselves, 
which are found in other code repositories called 'tool suites'
created from our suite repository template:

- tool suite template: <https://github.com/MiDataInt/mdi-suite-template>
