## {{page.title}} appStep module

The **assignSamples** appStep is the second step module of many apps.
It recognizes that many apps will seek to support 
data analyses in which one or more replicate samples will be 
organized into groups for comparison, thus defining a structure
of an experiment or project. 

The assignSamples UI allows users to:

- create a grid representing the categories that define a Sample Set
- assign names to the categories
- assign replicate Samples into the cells of the grid, i.e., combinations of categories
- use various automation tools to auto-fill grids
- save multiple distinct Samples Sets from the same data sources
- edit previously saved Samples Sets when necessary, e.g., to remove bad Samples

### Naming assignSamples steps

The canonical name given to assignSamples app steps is 'assign',
which matches the step type declared in assignSamples/module.yml.
We recommend following this convention as it promotes consistency and readability.

```yml
# <app>/config.yml
appSteps:
    assign:
        module: assignSamples
```

### Step dependencies: sourceFileUpload or selectSamples

All apps that use the assignSamples module must also use either 
sourceFileUpload or selectSamples
as their first step, as assignSamples reads its data from the
structured outcomes, i.e. data sources and samples, of those steps.

### Definition and structure of categories and sample sets

We use the term 'sample set' to refer to any combination of sample
assignments into categories. We avoid the term 'experiment' or similar
since the intent is that one experiment might yield
many different sample sets to support different queries against
the same data. 

At present, assignSamples supports up to two categorical
levels, shown as columns and rows of the grid. These are often
referred to as groups and conditions, but can be named anything (see below). 

Depending on the combination of an app's restrictions and the user's selections,
a given sample set might have just one pot for collecting a single list of samples,
or any number of groups and conditions.

### Module options

The assignSamples appStep requires that _\<app\>/config.yml_ declare 
the appropriate categories for downstream analysis steps, i.e., 
for the code that will use the assigned sample sets.

```yml
# <app>/config.yml
appSteps:
    assign:
        module: assignSamples        
        options:
            categories:
                <columnName>: # category level 1 = grid columns
                    singular: Example
                    plural: Examples
                    nLevels: 1:10
                <rowName>:    # category level 2 = grid rows
                    singular: Example
                    plural: Examples
                    nLevels: 1:10

```

Your app may choose to support zero, one, or two categorical levels.
Simply omit a level if you don't need it. Having no categories
means that users will only be offered single-pot assignments. 

The keys of the categorical levels are used to access values in code.

The user-friendly names shown in the app for the categorical levels are determined
by the `singular` and `plural` keys.

The `nLevels` keys establish the app's restrictions on the numbers
of rows and columns it expects and can support. Including `nLevels == 1`
means that your app doesn't require, but can support, 
a categorical level, e.g., it can support row x column as well as
column-only grids. Setting `nLevels:2` for both categories means
your app only supports 2 x 2 grids, etc.

### Returned outcomes

These are the outcomes returned by the assignSamples module that you may access
in downstream appStep modules.

```r
# assignSamples_server.R
list(
    outcomes = list(
        sampleSets     = reactive(data$list),
        sampleSetNames = reactive(data$names)  
    )
)
```
where:

- **sampleSets** = named list of the sample set assignments the user has saved (see below)
- **sampleSetNames** = named vector of the human-readable names the user gave to those sample sets; the names of sampleSetNames are the same as the names of sampleSets

The `sampleSets` reactive returns a list with members:

- **nLevels** = integer vector of the number of actual levels for two categories
- **nSamples** = the total number of assigned samples
- **assignments** = a data.frame of sample assignments (see below)
- **name** = a unique name for the sample set, not intended to be human-readable
- **categoryNames** = the names the user gave to the grid columns and rows (a list of two character vectors with lengths == nLevels)

The `assignments` data.frame has one row per assigned sample, with columns:

- **Source_ID** = the unique ID of the source data package. for data retrieval
- **Project** = the name of the project associated with Source_ID
- **Sample_ID** = the name of the sample
- **Category1** = the index (1 or 2) of the first categorical assignment (i.e., the grid column)
- **Category2** = the index (1 or 2) of the second categorical assignment (i.e., the grid row)

All members are present with values even if there is only one level, 
the category assignments will simply be set to 1. 

The concatenation of **Project** and **Sample_ID** together is used to 
create a unique identifier for a sample, since Sample_ID might
have been used repeatedly in different data sources.

Notice that each assigned sample will have exactly one row
in the `assignments` data.frame, i.e., the assignSamples module
supports the assignment of a sample to at most one grid position, 
since it rarely makes sense to compare a sample to itself. If there is 
a need to create multiple assignment pots that include the same sample,
do that by creating multiple sample sets.

Many apps do not access those outcomes directly, favoring
instead to use the following support utilities.

### Support utilities

These are the utility functions provided by the assignSamples module 
to make it easier to get information about a sample sets and assignments.

```r
# <scriptName>.R

# 'id' below is the name of a list entry in the sampleSets outcome

# get one or more user-assigned sample set names
sampleSetName  <- getSampleSetName(id)
sampleSetNames <- getSampleSetNames(rows = TRUE) # rows of the assignments table

# get sample set information as a list keyed by user-assigned names
sampleSets <- getSampleSetsNamedList(rows = TRUE)

# get the app-defined names of the categories in use
# a list whose names are Category1... and values are the user-friendly names
# unless invert=TRUE, then names and values are flipped
categoryNames <- getCategoryNames(plural = FALSE, invert = FALSE)

# retrieve the assignments for a specific Sample Set as a data.table
# optionally, filter for matching categories
# if categoryNames == TRUE, add columns Category1Name and Category2Name with user names
assignments <- getSampleSetAssignments(id, category1 = NULL, category2 = NULL, categoryNames = TRUE)

# retrieve the display name of one assigned sample
# sample is a one row of the assignments() data.table we wish to match
sampleName <- getAssignedSampleName(sample)
```
