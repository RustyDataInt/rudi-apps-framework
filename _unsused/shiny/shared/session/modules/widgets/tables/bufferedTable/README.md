## {{page.title}}

The **bufferedTable** widget displays data in a table rendered using the 
[R Shiny DT](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT/index.html)
package, itself a wrapper of the well-developed
[DataTables javascript library](https://datatables.net/).
These tools are tried and true - you don't need to fuss
to quickly make a well-formatted table.

The MDI widget makes it even easier to render tables well
and avoids pitfalls that can sometimes lead to undesirable
behavior.

`bufferedTable` places its output table into a shinydashboard `box()`
with optional links for downloading table data as a CSV file 
that can be opened in Microsoft Excel.

The module also provides support for embedding user inputs into
a tabular display.

### bufferedTableUI options

The `bufferedTableUI` function takes the following arguments in addition to 'id':

```r
# bufferedTable_ui.R
bufferedTableUI <- function(
    id, 
    title = NULL, 
    downloadable = FALSE, 
    ...
)
```

where:

- **title** = the title for the box
- **downloadable** = if TRUE, add a link to download table data as a CSV file
- **...** = additional arguments passed to shinydashboard `box()`

### bufferedTableServer options

The `bufferedTableServer` function takes the following arguments in addition to 'id':

```r
# bufferedTable_server.R
bufferedTableServer <- function(
    id,
    parentId,
    parentInput,
    tableData,
    editBoxes = list(),
    selection = 'single',
    selectionFn = function(selectedRows) NULL,
    options = list()
)
```

where:

- **id** = the id of the table widget
- **parentId** = the id of the module loading the widget
- **parentInput** = the `input` object passed from the module loading the widget
- **tableData** = reactive, or function with no arguments, that returns the table data
- **editBoxes** =  e.g., list(editBoxId = list(type=c('checkbox','textbox'), handler=function(d), boxColumn=1, [rawColumn=2])); see below
- **selection** = from DT, whether to allow row selections as 'single', 'multiple', or 'none'
- **selectionFn** = a function to call whenever the user performs updates row selection(s)
- **options** = passed as is to renderDT; see below

### bufferedTableServer return values

The module returns a list as follows:

```r
# bufferedTable_server.R
list(
    rows_selected = reactive({ input[[selectedId]] }),
    selectRows = function(rows) selectRows(proxy, rows),
    updateCell = updateCell,
    buffer = buffer
)
```

where:

- **rows_selected** = the DT value of the same name; an alternative way for caller to react to row selections
- **selectRows** = a method, i.e., function, for setting the row selection
- **updateCell** = a method, i.e., function, for setting the value of a data cell
- **buffer** = the cached, i.e., buffered version of the table data

Of these, only `rows_selected` is commonly used.

### Using the widget

First, place an instance of the bufferedTable widget in your UI 
(only widget-related code is shown):

```r
# <scriptName>_ui.R
bufferedTableUI(
    ns('id'),
    title = "My Table"
    downloadable = TRUE
    # ...  arguments passed to box()
)
```

Then activate the table in the matching server and provide
the data to fill the table, plus any added features of interest:

```r
# <scriptName>_server.R
myTableData <- reactive({
    data.frame(...)
})
myTable <- bufferedTableServer(
    'id',
    parentId = id, # id and input are passed from <scriptName>Server
    parentInput = input,
    tableData = myTableData
    # ...
)
```

### DT vs. DataTable options

The most confusing thing about `renderDT` (and thus `bufferedTable`)
is the `options` argument. The critical thing to understand is that
the values you set in `options` control the behavior of the DataTables
javascript library to which they are passed - not DT itself.

Thus, the values you set in `options` correspond directly to 
[DataTables huge list of options](https://datatables.net/reference/option/).
Please use that page as your reference for things you can do to your table.
Again, these values are handled in javascript on the client, not in R on the server.

The following example shows some of the more commonly used DataTable `options`:

```r
# <scriptName>_server.R
myTable <- bufferedTableServer(
    # ...
    options = list(
        paging = TRUE, # whether to split the table over multiple "pages"
        pageLength = 10, # the starting length of a single page
        lengthChange = TRUE, # allow user to change the length of a page
        lengthMenu = c(10, 25, 50, 100), # the page lengths offered in the menu
        searching = TRUE, # whether to show the table search input [TRUE]
    )
)
```

Not all DataTables options
work well with Shiny. Stick to the options listed above
or be prepared for possible troubleshooting.
See [this page](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/options.html) for more information.

### Handling row selections

There are two ways to react to a user's row selections.

First, provide a value for argument `selectionFn`, which is 
any function with a single argument that is a numerical
index of the selected table rows.

Alternatively, you may access the `rows_selected` reactive
found in the list returned by `bufferedTableServer`, which
provides the same numerical indices of selected rows.

### Placing inputs into bufferedTables

A nice feature of `bufferedTable` is that it makes it 
easy to put certain user inputs into your table, as communicated
with the `editBoxes` argument, which is a named list where
each element specifies a single column of inputs with one input
per table row, and the values in each element describes the input:

```r
# <scriptName>_server.R
bufferedTableServer(
    # ...
    editBoxes = list(
        myId = list(
            type = 'checkbox', # or textbox
            handler = myFunction(d) return(d), # see below
            boxColumn = 1 # the table of the column for the inputs
        )
    )
)
```

`handler` is a function that takes a single argument to receive
the information about a change in the value of one instance of
the input, which is a list of format:

```r
# as defined in getTableEditBoxData()
list(
    selectedRow = as.numeric(parts[2]), # numerical row index
    newValue = parts[5] # the new state of the input
)
```

You may do anything you'd like
with or to the object, as long as your handler returns
the object back to the bufferedTable module.
